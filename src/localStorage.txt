- Get localStorage value, use appropriate sortedList
  - probably done in componentDidMount
    - if there is a localStorage value, then do the sorted list,
    - else do the regular createArticleRows
- Might need to keep load number and beyondBootStrap in localStorage as
  - ** Need to ask whether just sorting preference needs to be restored
    when a user returns, or the number articles they had loaded as well


- Need to create sortedLists in the beginning
- Need to extract the results


- When something needs to happen is just as important a consideration
  as what your building
