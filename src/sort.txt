Ways to sort
- Sort by key
- Have arrays of articles sorted by words and submitted, and reverse sorted for each
  - Would need to think about how to change when more-articles are added
  - These would likely be arrays of article IDs
    - Then look up object would find based on IDs
      - And then probably place the article in the index of the array to be used for generating the rows
  - Would need to have sorted arrays in state, would need to create the arrays from "articles" when the component is first mounted, and then adjust them each time testXHR is called
    - Sort object with {words: id}
    - Need to think about duplicate word counts (i.e. two or more articles with the same word count)

How it would be done
Create sorted arrays
- [{words: 5, id: 1}, {words:3, id:2}]
- I need to take the word counts of each article and sort them
- Then I need to find the corresponding ID and put it in the right order
- Everything value could be an array of articles and I just concat

e.g. {
  3: [1]
  5:
}

- Create an object of key word counts: value array of article
- Then sort keys
- They for each sorted key, add old object's key and value to a new object, which should be sorted
- Then for each key concat the value into a new array, which will be the sorted list of articles


Sort arrays
- click sort
- look up correct sort array (e.g. words reverse)
